			<p>The University will use all reasonable endeavours to deliver courses and modules in accordance with the descriptions set out in the module catalogue. </p>
			<p>However the University does not provide education on a commercial basis. It is also largely dependent on charitable and public funds which the University has to manage in a way which is efficient and cost effective in the context of the provision of a wide range of courses and services to a large number of students. </p>
			<p>The University therefore reserves the right to make variations to the contents and method of delivery of courses and modules, to discontinue courses and modules and to merge or combine courses and modules, if such action is reasonably considered to be necessary by the University. </p>
			<p>If the University discontinues any course or module it will use its best endeavours to provide a suitable alternative.</p>
