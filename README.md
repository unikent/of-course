# Of Course!

A [Flight](http://flightphp.com/) based front-end application for the data produced by the [Programmes Plant](http://github.com/unikent/).

### Quick Deploy.

1. Checkout the [`master` of this app](http://github.com/unikent/of-course) from GitHub.
2. Run `composer.phar install` to grab [Flight](http://flightphp.com/).
2. Place where you would like it to live and rename `paths.sample.php` to `paths.php`. Set the XCRI WS path, base path and templating engine paths inside. We are using our home grown (closed source) Pantheon engine. If you are using Pantheon, add a Pantheon config.php to the config folder & a Pantheon menu folder within the tree.
4. Browse to the website to see the system up and running.
